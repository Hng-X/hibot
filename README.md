Call it "hai-bot" or call it "he-bot". Either way, it's a Slack bot built for the 2017 hotels.ng remote internship Slack team

## Why hibot?
Right now, there are almost 1000 people on the Slack team, leading to a lot of chaos. People keep asking the same questions and making the same requests of the same organisers, so we created this bot to help bring order from chaos. :slightly_smiling_face:

## So what does hibot do?
Currently, hibot:
* Sends each member of the team an onboarding DM when they join, pointing them to all the info they need to get started.
* Handles requests by users to be added to the Gitlab projects
* Handles requests by users to be added to the conjure.io projects
* Handles requests by users to be added to the pivotaltracker projects

## What next?
We keep thinking of innovative ways to put this bot to work to help streamline things. If you think of any, please shoot a mail to shalvah.adebayo@gmail.com

## How can I get one for my team?
We realised the logic of this bot was quite tightly coupled to this particular Slack team, so we've forked this project to [hubot](https://github.com/Hng-X/dobot). hubot will have a web interface, so you can easily add it to your team and set up a responses and stuff without needing to write any code. If you want it to perform more tasks specific to your team, then you can just fork the project.

## Anything else?
Yeah. Just in case you didn't know, hibot is built on Laravel, the PHP framework. Cool, right?

## Lest we forget...
hibot is not (yet) endorsed by or affiliated with Hotels.ng
